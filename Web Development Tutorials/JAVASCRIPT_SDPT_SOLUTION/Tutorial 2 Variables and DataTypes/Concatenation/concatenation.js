// Concatenation - Joining two or more strings together
// Concatenatng strings with other data types will automatically covert them into their sting counterparts. You can use variables and concatenate them! 

// Example: 
let $name = "Adi"; 
let $age = 21; 
alert("You are " + $name + ". You are " + $age + " years old.");
// let $name = document.getElementById("name"); 
// alert("Hi, " +$name.innerText);
